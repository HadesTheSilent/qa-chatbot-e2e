name: Sync docs to Wiki (disabled automatic run)

# NOTE: Automatic sync was causing push errors to the wiki repository
# (branch name / permission mismatches). The team has decided to
# manage the wiki content manually (organic text edits). To avoid
# accidental overwrites, this workflow no longer runs on push. It can
# still be triggered manually from the Actions tab if desired.
